				</li>
				<p>This project we looked more into python and used it to create an Interactive story. In this story me and my partner were trying to create a 
				different perspective of a female and a male in the same setting and place. Throughout the story they had to choose A or B, and per outcome they had to make a another 
				choice they'll have to make its similar to video games where you make a certain choice you survive or you don't.<p>
